# ERR_NGROK_415

### Message
Your account is limited to `MAX` reserved domains. By default, these overages are turned off so you're not surprised with any fees. You can turn them on (or off) at any time by going to the billing tab of your account > clicking "manage" next to subscription > scroll down to 'allow additional usage' > save changes. This will allow you to purchase more domains if you are on a Pro or Enterprise plan. Email sales@ngrok.com if you have any questions on purchasing domains in bulk. 

### Further help
